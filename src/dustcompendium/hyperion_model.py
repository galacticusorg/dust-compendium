r"""Turning a :class:`~dustcompendium.model.ModelSpec` into a Hyperion model.

This is the only module that needs Hyperion, and it is deliberately thin: the
grid, the dust density and the stellar emission map are all built in
:mod:`dustcompendium.model` with plain NumPy, and this hands them over along
with the settings the radiative transfer needs.

Those settings follow the original. The transfer is monochromatic, with no
initial iterations and photons killed on absorption, because the models are only
ever asked how much starlight escapes -- dust emission is not wanted and not
computed. Raytracing is on, and the output is a set of peel-off SEDs rather than
images.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spec
        The geometry, optical depths, wavelengths and inclinations.
    dust
        A Hyperion dust object, from :func:`dustcompendium.dust.load_dust` or
        built by :mod:`dustcompendium.dust.ferrara`.
    opacity
        The V band opacity per unit dust mass used to normalize the dust
        densities. Taken from ``dust`` when not given, which is what you want
        unless deliberately mismatching them.
    sampling
        How to sample the dust density; see
        :func:`~dustcompendium.model.dust_density`.
    **grid_options
        Passed through to :meth:`~dustcompendium.model.ModelSpec.grid`, for
        instance to change the number of cells.

    Raises
    ------
    ImportError
