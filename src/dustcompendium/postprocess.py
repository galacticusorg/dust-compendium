r"""Turning solved models into a tabulation.

Three steps, each of which the original did inline in its driver.

Peel-off directions are averaged in pairs. Every inclination is observed twice,
from opposite azimuths, which for an axisymmetric model are the same view; their
difference is pure Monte Carlo noise, so averaging them narrows it by root two
for nothing.

The result is divided by the model with no dust at all, which turns a luminosity
into the fraction of light escaping. Taking the ratio against a model of the same
geometry and the same random seed cancels much of the remaining noise.

Beyond the largest tabulated optical depth the transmission is extrapolated as
``exp(c0 + c1 ln tau)``, fitted over the top decade. The published files store
the two coefficients and nothing else, so nothing records how well that form
actually fits. Here the residual of the fit is kept alongside them, because the
power law is motivated by a disk -- at high optical depth only a surface layer is
seen -- and it is not obvious it holds for a spheroid whose central optical depth
formally diverges.
