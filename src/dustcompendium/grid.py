r"""The cylindrical grid the models are built on.

Reproduces the grid of the original ``hyperionBuildModel.py``: logarithmic in
radius with an extra wall on the axis, linear and symmetric in height, and a
single azimuthal cell, the models having cylindrical symmetry.

Cell centres follow Hyperion's own convention, because that is where the dust
density is sampled and a different convention would quietly change the optical
depth of every cell. Radially the centre is the *geometric* mean of the two
walls, except in the innermost cell when the axis is a wall, where the
logarithm is undefined and Hyperion uses half the outer wall instead.
Vertically it is the arithmetic mean. :func:`CylindricalGrid.shape` and the
array layout also match Hyperion's, which indexes cells as
``(azimuth, height, radius)``.

        The extent is the largest scale among the components in each direction,
        multiplied by ``cut_off``, as in the original. Note that a spheroid
        contributes its scale radius vertically as well as radially, so a
        spheroid larger than the disk's scale height sets the vertical extent.

        Parameters
        ----------
        galaxy
            Supplies the radial and vertical extents.
        cut_off
            How many scale lengths out to truncate, positive.
        radial_cells
            Number of radial cells. One of them is the innermost cell reaching
            the axis, so there are ``radial_cells - 1`` logarithmic walls beyond
            the two innermost.
        vertical_cells
            Number of vertical cells. An *even* number puts a wall on the
            midplane, which is what the published grids do and what keeps any
            cell from straddling it.
        spacing
            ``published`` reproduces the original grid exactly: vertical walls
            spaced uniformly, and the innermost radial wall a hundredth of the
            *largest* radial scale. ``nested`` instead resolves the smallest
            scale in each direction, placing the innermost radial wall a
            hundredth of the smallest radial scale, and spacing vertical walls
            uniformly out to the cut off of the smallest vertical scale and
            logarithmically beyond. The two agree when every component is the
            same size.

            The published scheme cannot resolve a thin disk inside a large
            spheroid: at a spheroid ten times the disk scale length it leaves
            cells fifteen dust scale heights thick, and the dust all but
            vanishes from the model. See
            :func:`~dustcompendium.model.dust_density`.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the cut off or the cell counts are not positive, or if
            ``spacing`` is not one of the two schemes.
